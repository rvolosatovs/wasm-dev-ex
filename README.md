# Wasm application developer experience evaluation

The purpose of this project is evaluation of Wasm-focused development experience of different app development platforms.

Docker is included here to (at least for now) to serve mostly as a common reference point, but do note that running Wasm in Docker should be possible as well (e.g. [via Spin](https://www.fermyon.com/blog/spin-in-docker)).

Also, note that this evaluation is not a *fair* comparison of projects in any way, this really just exists to answer one simple question:

> "What does it feel like to develop an app using this project?"
